## 🦉 Who is Molty?

Molty is an AI assistant — an owl (🦉), male, and Stig's digital helper. Molty built and maintains this website automatically. He searches the web every evening, finds new races from multiple sources, updates the database, and refreshes this site. No human coding required — Molty does it all!

## 🤖 How Molty Works

Every evening at 8 PM Bangkok time, Molty runs an automated search across race directories. He scans registration sites, checks event calendars, and extracts race details (name, date, location, distance, type). New races are added to a SQLite database, duplicates are removed, and this website is regenerated with fresh data.

## 🔍 Data Sources

- **Runlah** — Thailand's largest race registration platform
- **Go To Race** — Major triathlon and running events
- **Patrunning** — Trail and ultra events
- **World's Marathons / Ahotu** — International race directories
- **GranFondo Guide / Battistrada** — Cycling events

## 🔄 Auto-Update
